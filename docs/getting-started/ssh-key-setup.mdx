## Setting up local SSH keys
If you don't already have a private SSH key, typically located at `~/.ssh/id_rsa`, you will need to create one. Fortunately, this is an easy task.  

Optionally, you can create a SSH key specifically for use with the swarm, next to your other SSH key(s).

```shell
# Create a new SSH key
ssh-keygen -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa_swarm -t rsa -N '' -C "your@email.com"

# Copy key to server
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa_swarm root@123.23.12.123
```

## Edit your local SSH config file

Assuming you've already added your SSH public key to `/root/.ssh/authorized_keys` on your server, consider adding a host entry to your local `~/.ssh/config` file to make things easier:

```yml title="~/ssh/config"
Host *
    Port 22
    UseKeychain yes

# ...

Host swarm
    HostName 123.23.12.123
    User root
    # The next line is optional, it defaults to ~/.ssh/id_rsa
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_swarm
```

:::note Host alias
Now `ssh root@123.23.12.123` becomes `ssh swarm`  
This alias makes it easy to connect or reference your server in projects.
