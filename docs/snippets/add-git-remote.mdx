In order to push and deploy apps to the swarm, we need to add a git remote to our project repository.  
Swarmlet creates a user named 'git' on the server, this user handles incoming changes.  
If a project doesn't exist already, a new repo will be created on the swarm named `<project-name>`.  

:::note Remote user
When specifying a remote, the remote user **must** be 'git'. And because we've updated our `~/.ssh/config` file, we can specify the host by it's name, 'swarm' in this example.

Adding a git remote in a project that points to your server is as easy as running:
```shell
# Syntax:
git remote add <name> <user>@<host>:<project-name>

# Example:
git remote add swarm git@swarm:my-app
```


Now you can deploy an app simply by running `git push swarm master`  
Pretty easy to remember!
